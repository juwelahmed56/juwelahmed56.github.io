A Road Accident
Bangladesh is a very populated country. Here road management is very bad. Every day we find road accident news in daily newspapers. I also face a road accident. Everyday go my college by local bus. Like daily activities I was going for my bus. I was standing on the rod and waiting for the bus. Then I saw two little boys are crossing the busy road. They were not enough to cross the road. When they are crossing the road a bus push them in little speed. They were very afraid for his and they also little injured. One boy's leg was injured and another was injured in his hand. I rushed them and treatment them. I took a medicine from the nearby dispensary and used it on the injured place. They are crying for pain. I told them where from they are and where hey want to go. They said " They are going to school and they are from Khulna. After some moment I take them their hose. The boys parent were very socked to see their boys are ill. They were very sad. I told the full matter about the road accident. They thanked me. They also invited me to come their hose. I was gone their hose. And they offer me food. In this way I become common person to them.
